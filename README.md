This project looks at data about the planet Mars. It scrapes data from several websites using Jupyter Notebook and a python file. Using Mongo_DB and Flask, it then puts the data into an app. 

I was unable to make my chromedriver work outside of jupyter notebook, so there are no photos but I wrote the rest of the code that would make the app run to the best of my ability.
